# Use of Facial Expression Recognition on video data to improve Social Robotics

This repository contains the code used for my Bachelor Thesis in which I apply Facial Expression Recognition on video data from the [SOROCOVA project](https://sorocova.nl/en/sorocova/).

[Link to the pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ODO24RpaiRb9QMjCk1gLADwfevUxFPC4?usp=sharing).

The models should be put into the repository in the same locations as in the directory structure of the Drive.


Recreating the environment can be done by using the environment.yml with Conda. The Python packages are also stored in requirements.txt to be used with other environments.
Since this Conda environment was setup for our specific system (RTX 4070, CUDA 11.7, Ubuntu 22.04) it might prove difficult to recreate the environment.
 ```
conda env create -f <environment-name>.yml
```
